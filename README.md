Babel
=====

![](icon.png)

Web extension forcing [The Settlers Online](http://www.thesettlersonline.com/) to use the same language as your browser!

## How?

By simply translating one lang to another... oh wait! Wasn't that string replacement? See the source code.

## Where?

You will be able to install Babel with just one click soon.

- [Chrome Web Store]()
- [Firefox add-ons]()
- [Opera add-ons]()

## Permissions

Babel needs to read and change your data on a number of websites:

- http://juego-thesettlersonline.com
- http://www.diesiedleronline.de
- http://www.thesettlersonline.com
- http://www.thesettlersonline.com.br
- http://www.thesettlersonline.cz
- http://www.thesettlersonline.es
- http://www.thesettlersonline.fr
- http://www.thesettlersonline.gr
- http://www.thesettlersonline.it
- http://www.thesettlersonline.net
- http://www.thesettlersonline.nl
- http://www.thesettlersonline.pl
- http://www.thesettlersonline.ro
- http://www.thesettlersonline.ru
- http://www.tsotesting.com

It's dangerous to install this kind of extensions from untrusted sources.

This one is safe, however. Really, really.
